    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This apple and Gruyère slab pie proves that apples and cheese are a match made in heaven. Gruyère cheese adds balance to the Granny Smith apple filling and also provides a sharp savory flavor in the homemade crust. You can swap in sharp white Cheddar or Gouda cheese for the Gruyère.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3&frac34; cups flour</li>
        <li>1&frac14; butter</li>
        <li>1&frac12; cups shredded Gruyere cheese, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2/3 cup ice water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 pounds Granny smith or other tart apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 pounds Jonathan or other sweet cooking apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2&frac12; teaspoons apple pie spice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>Coarse sugar</li>
        <li>Vanilla ice cream, for serving</li>
        <li>Cinnamon, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Combine flour, 1&frac14; cups butter, 1/2 cup Gruyère, and the salt in a food processor; pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Combine ice water and vinegar in a small bowl; pour half into the food processor and pulse just until combined. Pour in remaining mixture; pulse until dough comes together, about 8 pulses. Divide dough in half. Shape into two (5x7-inch) rectangles. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Combine apple slices, brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, apple pie spice, thyme, cayenne (if using), and remaining 1 cup Gruyère in a very large bowl.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, extending parchment 2 inches over long sides of pan.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>On a lightly floured surface, roll each pastry portion into a 13x18-inch rectangle; transfer 1 portion to the prepared baking sheet, easing pastry into the corners. Spoon filling over pastry in the baking sheet, spreading evenly. Cut 1-inch strips from remaining portion (if you like, twist strips) and arrange over the filling. Use any scraps to create a border; trim edges, if needed, press edges with fork tines to seal.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Beat egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl for the egg wash; brush onto top of pastry.</p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 1 to 1&frac14; hours. Sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. Transfer pan to a wire rack; let cool 15 minutes. Use parchment to transfer pie from pan to a cutting board; cut into 16 pieces.</p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>Serve warm or let cool completely. Serve with ice cream and garnish with cinnamon.</p>
