# Project: Recipes

This is a simple HTML project that showcases recipes.

To build this, I had to apply the skills I've picked up so far, which include:

- Creating a HTML boilerplate
- Setting a proper file directory and structure
- Using git to track my changes
- Using the elements I've learned so far, p, h1, h2, h3, ol, ul, li and even HTML entities
- Adding images and links along with attributes
